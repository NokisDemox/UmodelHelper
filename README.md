# UmodelHelper
UmodelHelper is a GUI manager for UE Viewer (also known as umodel) versions and unreal engine games. Its made to manage game data like paths and AES keys (used in some UE games to encript the assets files) as well as umodel versions to easily extract or view game data.
## Why use UmodelHelper
Feels a bit tedious to use umodel as it requires you to input the game path, version and aes keys every time you open it, can be solved using .bat or .sh files to automate it. Depending on the game you are trying to use umodel, some versions of umodel may crash and you need to change to a newer or older, or even custom compiled version of the program.
UmodelHelper is made to manage your Unreal Engine games as well as your umodel installed versions.
Once you add a game to UmodelHelper its saved locally and can be open with any version of umodel you need, making it easier to manage your game and umodel versions.
## OS Support
Right now windows is the only OS supported, possibly will be adapted to also work on linux.
